## Description
In this repository you will find all of the personal projects I have worked on!

## Projects
### [Flags animation](https://github.com/Franciline/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Flags-pixel-animation)

A pixel animation of LGBTQ flags made using python.<br/>
Version of python needs to be 3.9 or more. <br/>

To run the file, you need to have **pygame** and **time** module. You can download the **pygame** module using the command in a terminal or a command prompt: <br/>
```python -m pip install pygame```<br/>

The **time** module is part of the Python Standard Library, so no installation is required. <br/><br/> 
To see the output, run the file in a IDE or by running the command ```python flags.py ``` in a terminal/command prompt.

### [ToDo List APP](https://github.com/Franciline/Personal-Projects/tree/main/ToDo-List-APP)
(on coding) <br/><br/>
Here I build a To Do List APP using PyQt5. <br/><br/>
Version of python used: **Python 3.11.9** <br/>
The **PyQt5** library is required (5.15.10 version used), to install it, enter in a terminal or command prompt: <br/>
```pip install PyQt5```<br/><br/>
You can find the documentation of the library here: https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/ <br/><br/>
I will use virtual environment in the ToDo-List-APP directory. To create it I run: <br/>
```python -m venv ToDo-List-APP```<br/>
then ```deactivate``` to deactivate it.
