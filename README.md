### [flags.py](https://github.com/Franciline/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Flags-pixel-animation)

A pixel animation of LGBTQ flags made using python.<br/>
Version of python needs to be 3.9 or more. <br/>

To run the file, you need to have **pygame** and **time** module. You can download the **pygame** module using the command in a terminal or a command prompt: <br/>
```python -m pip install pygame```<br/>

The **time** module is part of the Python Standard Library, so no installation is required. <br/><br/> 
To see the output, run the file in a IDE or by running the command ```python flags.py ``` in a terminal/command prompt.
