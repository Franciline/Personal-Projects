## Projects
### [flags.py](https://github.com/Franciline/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Flags-pixel-animation)
A pixel animation of LGBTQ flags made in python.
Version of python needs to be 3.9 or more. To run the file, you need to have **pygame** and **time** module. You can download the **pygame** module with: ```python -m pip install pygame```
The **time** module is part of the Python Standard Library, so no installation is required.  

To see the output, run the file in a IDE or by running the command ```python flags.py ``` in a terminal.
